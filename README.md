## React-Weather-App

This is weather forecast application that displays the current weather status, 12-hour forecast, and 5-day forecast. Location is queried based on your geolocation or manually searching a US based zip code.

## Motivation

The purpose of this app is to get myself familiarized with working in ReactJS, making API requests, handling API responses, manipulating data, using various libraries, and solving unforeseen quirks along the way.

The end goal is to have a functional app displaying the information needed in an organized manner.

### Built With:

- ReactJS - JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Bootstrap - CSS Framework
